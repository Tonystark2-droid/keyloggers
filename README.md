What is a Keylogger?
Keystroke logging (or keylogging) is the act of recording the keys pressed on a keyboard, typically covertly, so the user remains unaware that their input is being monitored. The data collected by the keylogger is later retrieved by the person who installed it. Keyloggers are often used to steal sensitive information like passwords, credit card numbers, and personal messages.

Even Microsoft has confirmed that Windows 10 includes telemetry features that include input data collection “to improve typing and writing functions,” although this is not the same as malicious keylogging.

Types of Keyloggers
1️⃣ Software-Based Keyloggers
Capture keystrokes using software running on the target system.

Additional features:

Clipboard logging: Captures copied text.

Screen capture: Takes screenshots at intervals or on trigger events.

Application hooks: Captures text from specific applications.

Network monitoring: Records browser history, search queries, email, chat logs, and file transfers.

Form grabbing: Extracts data from web forms before encryption.

2️⃣ Hardware-Based Keyloggers
Physical devices attached between the keyboard and computer or embedded inside the keyboard.

Advantages:

Operate at hardware level, independent of operating system.

Start logging as soon as the machine boots.

Harder to detect with antivirus software.

Variants:

USB or PS/2 inline devices.

Embedded keyboard modules.

Wireless keyloggers using radio interception.

How Keyloggers Work
Software keyloggers install hooks or inject DLLs into processes to intercept input.

Kernel-level keyloggers operate at the OS kernel, making them harder to detect.

Browser extensions or plugins can act as keyloggers by intercepting web form input.

Remote keyloggers send data to an attacker-controlled server using email, FTP, or HTTP/S.

How to Detect and Remove Keyloggers
Behavioral signs:

Slow system or browser performance.

Delayed keyboard or mouse response.

Unexpected crashes or error messages.

Unusual network activity.

Detection tools:

Antivirus/antimalware scanners.

Anti-rootkit utilities.

Task Manager / Activity Monitor.

Autoruns and startup scanners.

Firewall and network monitoring tools.

Removal methods:

Use reputable security software.

Check running processes and installed programs.

Perform offline or safe-mode scans.

For hardware keyloggers, physically inspect keyboard connections.

Prevention & Safety Tips
✅ Keep operating systems, browsers, and applications updated.
✅ Use strong, unique passwords and enable multi-factor authentication.
✅ Be cautious with email attachments and downloads.
✅ Avoid installing software from untrusted sources.
✅ Use hardware encryption for sensitive data.
✅ Regularly scan with updated antivirus/antimalware solutions.
✅ Consider using a password manager with an on-screen keyboard for critical logins.

Ethical Considerations
⚠ Important Reminder:
The use of keyloggers without consent is illegal and unethical. Keyloggers may only be used in environments where:

Explicit user consent is provided.

You own the device being monitored (e.g., for parental control).

It’s part of authorized penetration testing or research with written approval.

Unauthorized use can lead to criminal charges, lawsuits, and severe penalties.

Examples of Legitimate Use Cases
Parental control and monitoring.

Corporate security and compliance (with employee consent).

Personal device monitoring.

Academic research under ethical guidelines.

Penetration testing within scope of a legal agreement.
